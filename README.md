### Rails Engine is a mock back end for an E-Commerce site that allows you to query for Merchants and Items sorted in different ways.
Some endpoints are more straight forward such as "Finding all Merchants" while others have some Business Intelligence logic involved in the endpoint such as "Get Merhants with most Revenue".
